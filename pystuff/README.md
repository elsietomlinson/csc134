here are some prompts that i used to write this code
hey i'm doing some coding and i've got my ball moving but i want it to bounce across the screen like the dvd loading screen.mport pygame import sys

can you change the color so the ball goes from light green to dark green?
i got an error, AttributeError: module 'pygame.math' has no attribute 'sin' how can we fix this?
is there any way to make the ball look like it's made of jelly and have some way to make it have a bounce or recoil on it?
